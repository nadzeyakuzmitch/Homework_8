# Homework 8: Devops - Automated Builds Pushing to Dockeruhub Intro

In order to make publishing work I had to create a new security token in my Dockerhub account and set up secrets for the repo to include my username and token. I also needed to indicate correct repo name in the actions config. After that the build was able to be published to the Dockerhub. This is a screenshot of my published image.
